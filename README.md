# Micro-Bit
10 Activities for Using C/C++ with Micro::Bit

1. Make 10 Shapes. Scroll the shapes continuously. Understand how to use display related functions.
2. Display 25 dots randomly one by one. Clear the dots, and display the dots one by one over and over again.
3. Show A when Button A is clicked. B when Button B is clicked, and C when both buttons a clicked.
   Make the code using an infinite loop and interrupt.
4. Display one dot randomly in the matrix. Use Button A and B to move the dot left or right. Click both buttons to move the      dot up. When the dot is at the highest row and both buttons are clicked, move the dot to the bottom.
5. Make the same program as 4, but this time move the board so that accelerometer can catch the direction to move the dot.
6. Display current temperature in Celsius first when button A is clicked, and in Fahrenheit when button B is clicked.
7. Make a timer, it displays 0 to 9 and 0 again. Use both timer and nested loops. 
8. Make a dice that randomly generates a number between 1 and 6 when thrown. Measure the acceleration, and make a random          number from the measured data.
9. Send a message A and display A when button A is clicked, and likewise with B. The other board receives the message and show    the corresponding character.
10.Send current temperate to the other board in Celsius first when button A is clicked, and in Fahrenheit when button B is        clicked.

We use the DAL from Lancaster University on ARM Mbed https://ide.mbed.com/.
